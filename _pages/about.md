CIFRE Doctoral Candidate at Ecole CentraleSupelec, University of Paris-Saclay with Prof. Jean-Christophe Pesquet. My thesis revolves around Lipschitz Analysis of Neural Networks for certified robustness and certified defenses and is titled "Quantification of Robustness in Neural Networks". I am interested in robustness and trustworthiness of neural networks. 

I worked at Tata Consultancy Services Research and Innovation , Kolkata, India for three years before moving to France. I worked in Robotics and Vision Group.
