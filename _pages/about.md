CIFRE Doctoral Candidate with at Ecole CentraleSupelec, University of Paris-Saclay and Thales LAS France. Advised by Prof. Jean-Christophe Pesquet. My thesis revolves around Lipschitz Analysis of Neural Networks for certified robustness and adversarial machine learning. I am interested in robustness, trustworthiness and reliability of neural networks. 

I worked at Tata Consultancy Services Research and Innovation (2016-2019), Kolkata, India before moving to France. I worked in Robotics and Vision Group. I worked on 2D and 3D human pose estimation from monocular videos, inverse problems for removing blur in images captured from fast moving drones and rendering personalized realistic facial animation of an avatar using 3D Face meshes synced with audio. 

I completed my M.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering with specialization in Communication and Signal Processing from IIIT-Delhi and was a member of SALSA Research Lab (Batch 2014-2016). I did my masters thesis on Regularized Autoencoders under the guidance of Dr. Angshul Majumdar. I also worked on compressive sensing and collaborative filtering.
