Ph.D. Graduate specializing in the Robustness of neural networks from  Ecole CentraleSupelec, **University of Paris-Saclay** and funded by **Thales LAS France**. I was advised by Prof. Jean-Christophe Pesquet. My thesis revolves around Lipschitz Constant Analysis of Neural Networks for certified Robustness and adversarial machine learning. I am interested in the Robustness, trustworthiness, and reliability of neural networks. 

Before moving to France, I worked at **Tata Consultancy Services Research and Innovation** (2016-2019), Kolkata, India. I worked in Robotics and Vision Group. I worked on 2D and 3D human pose estimation from monocular videos, object detection and classification, inverse problems for removing blur in images captured from fast-moving drones, and rendering personalized realistic facial animation of an avatar using 3D Face meshes synced with audio. 

I completed my M.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering with specialization in Communication and Signal Processing from **IIIT-Delhi** and was a member of SALSA Research Lab (Batch 2014-2016). I did my master's thesis on Regularized Autoencoders under the guidance of [Dr. Angshul Majumdar](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~angshul/). I also worked on compressive sensing and collaborative filtering.
